## Hi It's me, Linus Torvalds , the founder of linux kernel.

You can check the url to confirm it definitely is me.

Recently I also got hooked on vtuber, especially a vtuber in China called [阿梓从小就很可爱](https://space.bilibili.com/7706705/video) _AKA 阿梓 or azi_ , so I decided to delete this project.

**Cheers**
